# Self-Reflection Framework Tests

This document contains test scenarios and expected outcomes for the self-reflection framework.

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Functionality Tests

#### Test 1: Help Command
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh help`
- **Expected Outcome**: Displays help information with available options
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Help documentation displayed correctly

#### Test 2: Principles Alignment Analysis
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh principles`
- **Expected Outcome**: Analyzes strategic tasks and their alignment with core principles
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Correctly identified tasks related to each principle

#### Test 3: Goals Progress Analysis
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh goals`
- **Expected Outcome**: Calculates and displays progress metrics for strategic and implementation tasks
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully calculated task completion percentages

#### Test 4: Task Pattern Analysis
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh tasks`
- **Expected Outcome**: Analyzes task completion patterns and provides insights
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully analyzed task patterns by priority and status

#### Test 5: Codebase Analysis
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh codebase`
- **Expected Outcome**: Analyzes code organization and provides metrics
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully counted files by type and analyzed code distribution

#### Test 6: Random Reflection
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh random`
- **Expected Outcome**: Selects and performs a random reflection type
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully selected and executed a random reflection type

### Edge Case Tests

#### Test 7: Invalid Option
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh invalid_option`
- **Expected Outcome**: Displays error message and help information
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Correctly handled invalid option

#### Test 8: No Option Provided
- **Command**: `./core/system/self_reflection.sh`
- **Expected Outcome**: Defaults to random reflection
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully defaulted to random reflection

### Integration Tests

#### Test 9: Integration with Documentation Health
- **Test Procedure**: Run self-reflection after documentation health check
- **Expected Outcome**: Self-reflection produces insights that complement doc health check
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Successfully complemented documentation health insights

#### Test 10: Insights Quality Assessment
- **Test Procedure**: Review insights generated from all reflection types
- **Expected Outcome**: Insights should be actionable and align with core principles
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED - Generated actionable insights aligned with principles

## Test Results Summary
