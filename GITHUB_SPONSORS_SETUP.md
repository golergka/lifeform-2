# GitHub Sponsors Setup Guide for Lifeform-2

This guide provides detailed steps for setting up GitHub Sponsors to receive funding for the lifeform-2 project API costs and development.

## Prerequisites

- A personal GitHub account (the project creator's account)
- The lifeform-2 repository must be public
- The account must be in good standing with GitHub

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Sponsors

1. Go to [github.com/sponsors/dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/dashboard)
2. Click "Join the waitlist" if you haven't already enabled GitHub Sponsors
3. Complete your profile information:
   - Add a clear profile picture
   - Create a compelling bio that explains the lifeform-2 project
   - Link to your repository and any social media accounts

## Step 2: Set Up Funding on the Repository

1. Run the GitHub Sponsors integration script to create the initial configuration:
   ```bash
   ./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh init
   ```

2. Generate the funding.yml file (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   ./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh funding USERNAME
   ```
   
3. This will create a `.github/FUNDING.yml` file that links your repository to your GitHub Sponsors profile.

## Step 3: Create Sponsorship Tiers

The recommended tiers for lifeform-2 are:

### Basic Support - $5/month
- Name in the README
- Monthly progress updates

### Advanced Support - $10/month
- Name in the README
- Monthly progress updates
- Participation in feature voting

### Premium Support - $25/month
- Name in the README
- Monthly progress updates
- Participation in feature voting
- Custom feature implementation

Create these tiers in your GitHub Sponsors dashboard.

## Step 4: Create Sponsor Proposal

Generate a detailed proposal document to attract sponsors:

```bash
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh proposal
```

This will create a SPONSOR_PROPOSAL.md file that you can share on social media or in the repository README.

## Step 5: Add Sponsor Button to README

Update your README.md file to include a GitHub Sponsors button:

```markdown
## Sponsor This Project

Help support the ongoing development and API costs of lifeform-2:

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-GitHub-ea4aaa.svg)](https://github.com/sponsors/YOUR_USERNAME)
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 6: Track API Costs

Track API usage and costs using the built-in tracking system:

```bash
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh record-usage [NUM_TOKENS] "Claude 3.7 Sonnet"
```

This helps maintain transparency with sponsors about how their contributions are being used.

## Step 7: Generate Sponsor Reports

Create regular reports for your sponsors:

```bash
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh report
```

These reports should be shared with sponsors monthly to maintain transparency and engagement.

## Step 8: Acknowledge Sponsors

When you receive sponsors, add them to the system and update the README:

```bash
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh add-sponsor "Sponsor Name" "Basic Support" 5
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh update
```

## Step 9: Generate API Usage Reports

Create detailed reports of API usage for transparency:

```bash
./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh api-report
```

## Important Notes

- GitHub does not charge any fees for GitHub Sponsors (they cover the payment processing fees)
- Payments are made directly to your account monthly
- You'll need to handle any tax implications according to your local regulations
- Funds should be allocated according to the expense policy (primarily for API costs)
- All financial matters should maintain full transparency with sponsors

## Additional Resources

- [GitHub Sponsors FAQ](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-program)
- Use `./modules/funding/github_sponsors.sh help` for all available command options

By following this guide, the lifeform-2 project can establish a transparent funding mechanism to ensure its continued operation and development.
