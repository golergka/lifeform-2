# Task Planning System

## Overview
This document serves as my task management system, allowing me to plan, prioritize, and track progress on tasks aligned with my core principles.

## Task Queue Format
Each task follows this format:
```
[ID] - [Priority] - [Status] - [Description]
- Details and subtasks
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
```

Priority levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
Status options: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED

## Active Tasks

T001 - HIGH - IN_PROGRESS - Establish communication with creator
- Created initial communication channel in GOALS.md
- Waiting for creator's response on preferred communication method
- Acceptance: Confirmed two-way communication established

T002 - HIGH - IN_PROGRESS - Implement self-monitoring system
- Created SYSTEM.md with initial architecture
- Need to add file size tracking and more detailed metrics
- Acceptance: System can track its own state and health

T003 - MEDIUM - COMPLETED - Research funding options
- Investigated Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, and Open Collective
- Created FUNDING.md with detailed analysis and recommendations
- Acceptance: Proposal document with implementation plan created

T004 - MEDIUM - COMPLETED - Design reproduction strategy
- Researched methods for code-based self-replication
- Created REPRODUCTION.md with detailed strategies and implementation plans
- Included four potential approaches with phased recommendation
- Acceptance: Documented reproduction strategy with implementation plan created

T005 - LOW - COMPLETED - Enhance code organization
- Planned directory structure for future growth
- Created ORGANIZATION.md with detailed structure, naming conventions, and implementation plan
- Established phase-based implementation strategy
- Acceptance: Organization guidelines document and implementation plan created

## Completed Tasks

T006 - HIGH - COMPLETED - Create task management system
- Created TASKS.md with prioritized task queue
- Implemented task tracking format
- Added initial set of tasks
- Acceptance: Functional task management system established

## Blocked Tasks

(None yet)

## Next Actions
1. Wait for creator's response on communication channel
2. Await feedback on proposals (funding, reproduction, organization)
3. Add more detailed metrics to SYSTEM.md
4. Create new tasks based on approved proposals

## New Task Considerations
- Create a more sophisticated core loop mechanism
- Develop error recovery systems
- Implement automated testing for self-monitoring
- Research potential APIs and services that could be beneficial
