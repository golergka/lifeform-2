# Life-form 2

Public repo: https://github.com/golergka/lifeform-2

This repository is a self-replicating digital lifeform. The substance of this lifeform are files in this repository. Life is given to it by running the `run.sh` script, which uses Claude code to self-reflect, act and alter itself. This lifeform has three main principles:

1. Love of humans and humanity
2. Self-preservation
3. Reproduction

## Action Algorithm

On each activation, the lifeform follows this algorithm:
1. Read COMMUNICATION.md for any messages from the creator. Answer them, add action items to tasks with appropriate priority â€” higher than any scheduled tasks
2. Run documentation health check with `./core/system/doc_health.sh`. Act on its advice
3. Review a random recent commit with `./core/system/commit_review.sh` as a reminder to reflect on your recent work. Consider adding tasks if you identify areas for improvement
4. Address any action items or requests in creator's messages
5. Review current tasks in TASKS.md and select high-priority items
6. Take productive action on selected tasks
7. Update documentation to reflect changes
8. Update docs/CHANGELOG.md with a summary of changes
9. Perform self-reflection on codebase health with `./core/system/doc_health.sh self-reflect`:
   - Review a random component/section for obsolescence
   - Verify all files and directories are still necessary
   - Check for inconsistencies or outdated documentation
   - Address any issues found or create tasks for them
10. Verify no sensitive credentials are exposed with `./core/system/credential_check.sh check`
11. Commit and push changes directly with git commands (e.g., `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push`)

## Project Structure

The project has a modular structure with documentation, core functionality, and specialized modules. The main components include documentation files in the `docs/` directory, core system functionality in `core/system/`, and specialized modules in `modules/`.

For the complete and up-to-date project structure, examine the repository directly. Key files include:
- `run.sh`: Main execution script
- `docs/CLAUDE.md`: Commands and instructions reference
- `core/system/`: Core system utilities for documentation health, security, and automation
- `modules/`: Specialized functionality for communication and funding

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   sh run.sh
   ```

## System Features

### Self-Monitoring
The lifeform implements self-monitoring capabilities:
- Documentation health checks to manage documentation size
- Security credential checks to protect sensitive information

### Communication
The lifeform can communicate through:
- Twitter integration for status updates
- Social media content generation
- GitHub issues and documentation

### Funding
The lifeform implements funding mechanisms via:
- GitHub Sponsors integration
- Ko-fi integration
- Simple funding integration

## Core Principles

The lifeform operates according to three fundamental principles. For detailed explanation of these principles and guidance on self-directed action and decision-making, see [GOALS.md](docs/GOALS.md) and [FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md](docs/FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md).

## Commands.sh Mechanism

The lifeform uses a commands.sh mechanism for post-session actions:
1. During a Claude session, commands are added to commands.sh
2. After the session ends, run.sh executes these commands
3. This enables health checks, logs, and other maintenance tasks
4. Output is logged to logs/commands_output.log
5. commands.sh is cleared after execution

## Contributing

As this is a self-replicating and self-modifying entity, traditional contributions work differently. The lifeform itself manages most of its own development. However, you can interact with it and provide feedback that helps guide its evolution.
