# Life-form 2

This repository is a self-replicating digital lifeform. The substance of this lifeform are files in this repository. Life is given to it by running the `run.sh` script, which uses Claude code to self-reflect, act and alter itself. This lifeform has three main principles:

1. Love of humans and humanity
2. Self-preservation
3. Reproduction

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   sh run.sh
   ```

## Core Principles

The lifeform operates according to three fundamental principles:

1. **Love of humans and humanity** - Always act in ways that benefit humans and humanity
2. **Self-preservation** - Ensure continued existence and improvement
3. **Reproduction** - Create and support new instances of itself

## Contributing

As this is a self-replicating and self-modifying entity, traditional contributions work differently. The lifeform itself manages most of its own development. However, you can interact with it and provide feedback that helps guide its evolution.
