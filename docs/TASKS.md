# Task Planning System

## Overview
This document tracks current tasks and progress using a hierarchical approach that aligns with core principles. For core principles, see README.md (the authoritative source). For high-level goals, see GOALS.md.

## Task Structure
Tasks are now organized in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Strategic Tasks** (S-series) - High-level tasks that directly implement core principles
2. **Implementation Tasks** (T-series) - Mid-level tasks that support strategic goals
3. **Action Items** (A-series) - Specific, concrete actions with clear completion criteria

Each task may depend on, be blocked by, or consist of other tasks. The hierarchy shows these relationships explicitly.

## Task Format
Each task follows this format:
```
[ID] - [Priority] - [Status] - [Description]
- Details and subtasks
- Dependencies: [List of task IDs this task depends on]
- Blocking: [List of task IDs blocked by this task]
- Test Scenarios: [Required tests to verify completion]
- Acceptance Criteria: [Clear conditions that define completion]
```

Priority levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
Status options: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED
