# Task Planning System

## Overview
This document tracks current tasks and progress. For core principles and high-level goals, see GOALS.md.

## Task Queue Format
Each task follows this format:
```
[ID] - [Priority] - [Status] - [Description]
- Details and subtasks
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies
```

Priority levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
Status options: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED
