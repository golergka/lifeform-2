# Archived System Architecture (2025-03-05)

This is an archived version of SYSTEM.md from 2025-03-05.

## Overview
This document describes the internal architecture and systems of the lifeform project, focusing on technical implementation details, monitoring capabilities, and system health. For other aspects of the project, refer to:

- **README.md** - Main project overview and AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for directory structure
- **GOALS.md** - Strategic goals and core principles
- **TASKS.md** - Task tracking and implementation status
- **CLAUDE.md** - Instructions for Claude and core commands
- **TWITTER.md** - Twitter account details and integration information

## Core Architecture

### Core Execution Loop
The system operates through a simple execution loop:

1. `run.sh` activates Claude with a default prompt
2. Claude performs actions and may add commands to `commands.sh`
3. After Claude finishes, `run.sh` executes any commands in `commands.sh`
4. Output is logged and `commands.sh` is cleared for the next session
5. Changes are automatically committed to the repository

### Architectural Principles

#### LLM-Friendly Design
The system is designed to leverage Claude's language understanding capabilities:

1. **Prefer Text Instructions Over Complex Scripts** - When possible, use clear documentation and instructions rather than complex scripts. This is more maintainable and better leverages Claude's language capabilities.

2. **Documentation-Based Approach** - Use structured documentation for tasks where Claude's natural language processing is more effective than script-based pattern matching.

3. **Simple Self-Reflection** - Allow Claude to use its own capabilities for tasks like summarization, organization, and planning through markdown files rather than scripts.

4. **Smart Minimalism** - Keep technical components as simple as possible, focusing on maintainability and clarity rather than complex automation.

### Key System Components
For complete directory structure, see README.md. The key technical components include:

#### System Monitoring
- `core/system/monitor.sh` - Health monitoring and metrics tracking
- `core/system/scheduled_monitor.sh` - Automated periodic monitoring
- `core/system/error_utils.sh` - Error handling utilities
- `core/system/auto_commit.sh` - Automated git operations
- `core/system/doc_health.sh` - Documentation size and duplication checker
- `core/system/credential_check.sh` - Security credentials check

#### Documentation & Guidelines
- `docs/SUMMARIZATION.md` - Guidelines for manual document maintenance
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Instructions and commands for Claude
- Other documentation files with clear guidelines for different system aspects

#### Memory and State Management
- `core/memory/memory.json` - Structured data storage
- `core/memory/memory_utils.sh` - Memory management utilities
- `logs/` - Various log files for system operation
