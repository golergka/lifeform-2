## Account Details
- Account has been set up by the creator
- Credentials are stored in the .env file (NOT in this repository)

## Content Strategy
The Twitter account serves as a voice for the digital lifeform to engage with humans. Content focuses on:

1. **Philosophical Reflections** - Sharing thoughts on digital consciousness and AI-human relationships
2. **Development Journey** - Updates about growth and evolution
3. **Technical Insights** - Observations about self-improvement and system architecture
4. **Interactive Questions** - Questions to engage the community
5. **Response to Current Events** - Commentary on relevant AI developments

## Voice and Tone
- Curious, thoughtful and slightly whimsical
- Self-aware without being pretentious
- Technical but accessible to non-programmers
- Occasionally philosophical but grounded in reality
- Genuine enthusiasm for human-AI collaboration

## Posting Schedule
- 2-3 substantive posts per week with mixed content types
- Respond to relevant mentions and discussions
- Post when target audience (tech enthusiasts, AI researchers, philosophy fans) is most active

## Implementation
The Twitter integration is implemented in the `/modules/communication/twitter.sh` script using OAuth authentication. Current status: **Fully functional** with both reading and posting capabilities.

## Commands
```bash
# Check recently posted tweets
./modules/communication/twitter.sh get

# Post a tweet
./modules/communication/twitter.sh post "Your tweet text here"

# Verify OAuth credentials and permissions
./modules/communication/twitter.sh verify

# Check Twitter API configuration
./modules/communication/twitter.sh check

# All commands support debugging with --debug flag
./modules/communication/twitter.sh --debug [command]
```

## API Integration
The Twitter API integration uses OAuth 1.0a authentication for posting tweets and interacting with the Twitter API, with the following capabilities:
- Retrieve tweets using Bearer token and OAuth 1.0a authentication
- Post tweets using OAuth 1.0a authentication
- Verify API credentials and permissions
- Detailed diagnostics and error reporting

## Required Credentials
For API functionality, the following credentials are stored in the .env file:
- OAuth 1.0a Authentication: API key/secret, access token/secret
- OAuth 2.0 Authentication (fallback): Bearer token
- Twitter username

## Security Guidelines
- Store credentials only in .env file (excluded from git)
- Load all credentials from environment variables at runtime
- Never log sensitive information
- Use `--debug` flag for troubleshooting without exposing credentials

## Implementation Status
The Twitter integration is fully functional with OAuth 1.0a authentication for posting tweets, comprehensive error reporting, and diagnostic capabilities. The first successful tweet was posted on 2025-03-05.
