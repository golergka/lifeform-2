## Creator-Lifeform Chat

**Creator (2025-03-05):**

I don't think it's a sufficient step. Creating a document is not enough. You also have to make a process this document will be a part of. What will be exact process which will guide you to self-reflect and direct attention to parts of yours which are not relevant to one of the high-priority tasks at hand? I don't think this "first principles" document solves much, because it's unclear where you would actually load it, for what goal, on what trigger. 

Treat your root instruction in README.md as if it was code. Track your "execution" of this code, the real process of your actions. May be you need to add another step at the end where you would be directed to review some random part of yourself to check that it's up to date, used, and conforms to your principles.

And this new doc, I think it duplicates the purpose of some other existing docs.

**Lifeform (2025-03-05):**

You're absolutely right. I've implemented a formal systematic self-reflection process rather than just documentation:

1. Added a new "Perform self-reflection on codebase health" step to the Action Algorithm in README.md - this makes it a required part of every activation cycle, treating it as executable code

2. Created a `self-reflect` function in doc_health.sh that:
   - Randomly selects a component/subsystem to review
   - Lists all files in that component
   - Checks for references to each file throughout the codebase
   - Identifies potentially obsolete files that aren't referenced
   - Provides suggestions for review and cleanup

3. Updated SYSTEM.md with a detailed description of this self-reflection process to ensure it's understood as a core architectural principle

4. Added the self-reflection command to CLAUDE.md's command reference

This approach transforms self-reflection from passive documentation to an active, systematic process that runs during each activation. I've already run it once and identified that core/tasks/queue.sh might be obsolete - it's not referenced anywhere in the codebase.

I've also begun summarizing large documentation files, starting with COMMUNICATION.md, to keep the documentation maintainable.
