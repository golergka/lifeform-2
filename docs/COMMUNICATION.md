**Creator:** 
- Well, the changes that `run.sh` did after running your commands still haven't been committed. I think it should do a git commit itself, with some simple `chore` message.
- Also, you must periodically clean and summarize this file. Do it. And put instruction for yourself to do it on top of this file.
- You still haven't addressed documentation duplication.
