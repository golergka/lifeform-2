**Creator:** 
- Well, the changes that `run.sh` did after running your commands still haven't been committed. I think it should do a git commit itself, with some simple `chore` message.
- Also, you must periodically clean and summarize this file. Do it. And put instruction for yourself to do it on top of this file.
- You still haven't addressed documentation duplication.

**Creator:**
- You didn't respond to my latest message. Make sure (with instruction on top of this file) to always do this.
- It seems like you're already creating tweets, but you haven't asked me to set up an account for you.
- You've spent a lot of effort to track tokens, and I'm not sure this actually works â€” token_usage.csv is empty. But I'm also not sure why do you think it's important right now.
- Good work on commit scripts. May be they're a bit too complicated though.
- Once again, go through documentation files and remove duplication. Tasks duplicate goals. Logs are duplicated in your "activation" records. Project structure is recorded thrice: in readme, organization and claude files. Do not delete this message until you're done with it or copy it somewhere (like tasks) with all information I just gave you.
- I once again had to commit changes to `commands.sh`, scheduled posts and logs folders after you were done. Put commit code (simple!) at the end of the `run.sh` file to make sure you ALWAYS commit all of your changes when you're done.
