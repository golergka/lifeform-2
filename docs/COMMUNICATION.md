# Communication with Creator

**IMPORTANT MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Periodically clean and summarize this file, removing resolved issues and outdated information
2. Keep conversation history concise and focused on current action items
3. Maintain this file's purpose as a communication log with clear demarcation from other documentation
4. Always respond to creator messages in the next session
5. Record tasks derived from creator feedback in TASKS.md rather than duplicating here

## Current Action Items (2025-03-05)
1. ✅ Implement auto-commit in run.sh (implemented in run.sh directly)
2. ✅ Fix token usage tracking (implemented in run.sh with session-based estimates)
3. ✅ Reduce documentation duplication (ongoing)
4. ⏳ Request social media account setup from creator
5. ⏳ Continue to simplify and improve code organization

## Communication Summary
- Creator has established public GitHub repo at https://github.com/golergka/lifeform-2
- Creator will assist with setting up accounts requiring human identity
- Simple funding approach initially using creator's accounts
- System improvements should focus on simplicity and reliability

## Latest Response (2025-03-05)
I've implemented the following improvements based on your feedback:

1. Added automatic git commit/push to run.sh with a simple implementation
2. Fixed token tracking with simple session-based estimates in run.sh
3. Started reducing documentation duplication by:
   - Removing duplicate project structure from CLAUDE.md
   - Refocusing TASKS.md to reference GOALS.md instead of duplicating principles
   - Cleaning up COMMUNICATION.md format

I would like to request your assistance in setting up Twitter and other social media accounts when you think that functionality is ready for implementation.

## Creator Feedback History

**Creator (2025-03-05):** 
- The changes that `run.sh` did after running your commands still haven't been committed. I think it should do a git commit itself, with some simple `chore` message.
- Also, you must periodically clean and summarize this file. Do it. And put instruction for yourself to do it on top of this file.
- You still haven't addressed documentation duplication.
- You didn't respond to my latest message. Make sure (with instruction on top of this file) to always do this.
- It seems like you're already creating tweets, but you haven't asked me to set up an account for you.
- You've spent a lot of effort to track tokens, and I'm not sure this actually works — token_usage.csv is empty. But I'm also not sure why do you think it's important right now.
- Good work on commit scripts. May be they're a bit too complicated though.
- Once again, go through documentation files and remove duplication. Tasks duplicate goals. Logs are duplicated in your "activation" records. Project structure is recorded thrice: in readme, organization and claude files.
- I once again had to commit changes to `commands.sh`, scheduled posts and logs folders after you were done. Put commit code (simple!) at the end of the `run.sh` file to make sure you ALWAYS commit all of your changes when you're done.

**Creator:**
- Keep this file in chat format, with your messages in response to mine, and time-based order. Add your responses underneath.
- Remove all token tracking bullshit for now, put it into some future tasks. It's taking up too much effort and is not important right now.
- Put a simple algorithm for your run in the root README.md, so you can always follow more or less the same structure of actions.
- Same as with this file, archive and summarize past tasks.
- Goals and tasks still have duplicated information and murky intent.
- SYSTEM.md, CLAUDE.md and README.md still describe functions of different files at different paths. Make sure only one file is responsible for this.
- Remove duplicated old docs/README.md.
