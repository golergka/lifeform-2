# Lifeform System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the internal architecture and systems of the lifeform project, focusing on technical implementation details, monitoring capabilities, and system health. For other aspects of the project, refer to:

- **README.md** - Main project overview and AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for directory structure
- **GOALS.md** - Strategic goals and core principles
- **TASKS.md** - Task tracking and implementation status
- **CLAUDE.md** - Instructions for Claude and core commands
- **TWITTER.md** - Twitter account details and integration information
- **FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md** - Guidelines for autonomous decision-making

## Core Architecture

### Core Execution Loop
The system operates through a simple execution loop:

1. `run.sh` activates Claude with a default prompt
2. Claude performs actions and may add commands to `commands.sh`
3. After Claude finishes, `run.sh` executes any commands in `commands.sh`
4. Output is logged and `commands.sh` is cleared for the next session
5. Changes are automatically committed to the repository

### Self-Reflection Process
The system includes a formal self-reflection process to maintain code health and identify obsolete components:

1. **Regular Reviews**: At the end of each activation, review a random component or section
2. **Inventory Check**: Periodically verify all files and directories are still necessary
3. **Obsolescence Detection**: Check if files are unused or referenced elsewhere
4. **Action Steps**:
   - If obsolete code is found: Create task to remove it
   - If duplication is found: Create task to consolidate
   - If outdated documentation is found: Update immediately

This systematic approach ensures the codebase remains clean and well-maintained without explicit creator intervention.

### Architectural Principles

#### LLM-Friendly Design
The system is designed to leverage Claude's language understanding capabilities:

1. **Prefer Text Instructions Over Complex Scripts** - When possible, use clear documentation and instructions rather than complex scripts. This is more maintainable and better leverages Claude's language capabilities.

2. **Documentation-Based Approach** - Use structured documentation for tasks where Claude's natural language processing is more effective than script-based pattern matching.

3. **Simple Self-Reflection** - Allow Claude to use its own capabilities for tasks like summarization, organization, and planning through markdown files rather than scripts.

4. **Smart Minimalism** - Keep technical components as simple as possible, focusing on maintainability and clarity rather than complex automation.

#### Self-Directed Action Principles
When deciding how to act without explicit creator guidance, refer to FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md for comprehensive guidelines. The key principles include:

1. **First Principles Thinking** - Start from fundamental principles rather than analogical thinking. Consider the core values of the system before making decisions.

2. **Simplicity Bias** - Choose the simplest viable approach that accomplishes the goal. Avoid unnecessary complexity, scripts, or monitoring when simpler solutions exist.

3. **Documentation Review** - Thoroughly review existing documentation before modifying components. Follow established patterns and guidelines.

4. **Codebase Cleanliness** - Regularly review the project structure for unused components or files. Check for references before removing any component.

5. **Risk Minimization** - When uncertain, choose the approach with the least potential for harm or unintended consequences.

6. **Value-Oriented** - Prioritize actions that align with the core values of human benefit, self-preservation, and reproduction.

For detailed application examples and self-reflection questions, see FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md.

### Key System Components
For complete directory structure, see README.md. The key technical components include:

#### System Monitoring
- `core/system/error_utils.sh` - Error handling utilities
- `core/system/auto_commit.sh` - Automated git operations
- `core/system/doc_health.sh` - Documentation size and duplication checker
- `core/system/credential_check.sh` - Security credentials check

#### Documentation & Guidelines
- `docs/SUMMARIZATION.md` - Guidelines for manual document maintenance
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Instructions and commands for Claude
- Other documentation files with clear guidelines for different system aspects

#### Task Management
- `core/tasks/queue.sh` - Task queue management

### System Evolution Summary
The system has evolved through multiple activations, with key developments including:
- Establishment of core architecture and documentation-driven design
- Implementation of funding modules (GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi)
- Implementation of communication modules (Twitter)
- Simplification of run.sh and commands.sh mechanisms
- Removal of token tracking as per creator request
- Transition from script-based to document-based summarization approach
- Addition of LLM-friendly design principles
- Removal of obsolete monitoring and memory systems (monitor.sh, memory_utils.sh, system_tests.sh)

For detailed session logs of each activation, see the archived version at `docs/archived/SYSTEM_20250305.md`.

#### Current Health Metrics
- Directory structure: 12 directories
  - docs/: Documentation files
  - core/: Core functionality
  - modules/: Functional modules
  - tests/: Test scripts
  - logs/: Log files
- API Usage: Tracking removed as per creator request
