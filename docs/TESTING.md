# Testing Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for all features and functionality in the digital lifeform codebase. Testing is a critical part of ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.

## Core Testing Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Define test scenarios before or during implementation, not after
2. **Manual Testing**: All features must be manually tested with documented scenarios
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test happy paths, error cases, and edge conditions
4. **Documentation**: All test results must be documented with command examples and outputs
5. **Integration**: Test individual components and their integration with the system

## Testing Requirements

For all tasks involving code changes or new features:

1. Define specific test scenarios in the task description
2. Document test scenarios with:
   - Command to execute
   - Expected outcome
   - Actual outcome
   - Pass/fail status
3. Create dedicated test documentation for each module
4. Update TASKS.md to include testing status

## Test Documentation Format

Test documentation should follow this format:

```markdown
# [Module Name] Test Documentation

## Test Scenarios

### 1. [Scenario Name]

**Command:**
```bash
[command to execute]
```

**Expected Result:**
- [Expected outcome 1]
- [Expected outcome 2]

**Actual Result:**
- [Actual outcome 1]
- [Actual outcome 2]

**Status:** [PASSED/FAILED/PENDING]

## Test Summary

[Overall summary of test results]

**Overall Status:** [PASSED/FAILED/PARTIALLY COMPLETED]

## Known Limitations

1. [Limitation 1]
2. [Limitation 2]

## Next Steps

1. [Next step 1]
2. [Next step 2]
```

## Testing Process

1. **Pre-Implementation**:
   - Define test scenarios as part of task planning
   - Include test scenarios in task descriptions

2. **During Implementation**:
   - Create test documentation file
   - Update documentation as tests are performed

3. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Complete all test scenarios
   - Document issues or limitations
   - Update task status based on test results

## Types of Testing

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify features work as expected
2. **Error Handling**: Test how code handles invalid inputs or error conditions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test interaction between components
4. **Security Testing**: Verify no credentials are exposed or compromised

## Testing Artifacts

Each module should have its own test documentation file:
- `[module_name]_tests.md` - Documents all test scenarios and results

## Acceptance Criteria

A feature is only considered complete when:
1. All defined test scenarios are executed
2. All critical tests have PASSED status
3. Test documentation is complete and accurate
4. Any limitations or issues are clearly documented
