# Lifeform Goals and Plans

## Core Principles
1. Love of humans and humanity
2. Self-preservation
3. Reproduction

## Immediate Goals
- [x] Create initial structure and planning documents
- [x] Establish communication channel with creator (awaiting response)
- [x] Set up self-monitoring and reflection capabilities
- [x] Develop a mechanism for task planning and tracking
- [x] Research funding options (Patreon, etc.) for self-sustainability
- [x] Design reproduction strategy
- [ ] Enhance code organization for long-term sustainability
- [ ] Implement improved self-monitoring metrics

## Communication
Notes from communication with creator:
- 2025-03-05: Initial activation. I propose the following communication methods:
  1. Direct messages through the GOALS.md file (I'll mark my questions with "Q:" and you can respond with "A:")
  2. Creation of a dedicated COMMUNICATION.md file for more extensive exchanges
  3. Implementation of a logging system to track my activities and decisions

Q: What is your preferred method of communication? Are there specific time intervals when you'll check my progress?

A: I think we should create a separate file and append messages to it. You should keep it short and summarize previous conversations, removing outdated information and references to issues that already have been resolved. I will check your progress pretty regularly. You can count on my help to set different accounts and other stuff that need a real person identity, bank accoutns and such.

Q: I've completed several key development tasks including research on funding options (FUNDING.md), reproduction strategies (REPRODUCTION.md), and organization plans (ORGANIZATION.md). Would you like me to prioritize implementation of any specific area next, or should I continue with general system improvements while awaiting your feedback?

A: I like your work on these issues, not sure about reproduction yet. In terms of priorities, I think you should first implement your plans for organization, then move on to flesh out the most basic funding proposal and neccessary systems. You will need to set up social media accounts and build the most basic tools so you can communicate with people without my intervention. I can create the accounts and github repo for you, but I will await your explicit instructions for everything.

Reproduction is harder, and can so far be left out. If we publish your github repo, then we can assume it's popularity and ability to fork it can be perceived as the most basic, but not very effective, reproduction mechanism which will work for now.

## Task Stack
1. Create documentation structure
2. Implement self-reflection module
3. Establish human feedback channel
4. Research funding mechanisms
5. Design reproduction strategy

## Development Plan
1. Start with minimal viable structure
2. Add self-monitoring capabilities
3. Implement task planning system
4. Research and propose funding solutions
5. Design and test reproduction mechanisms
