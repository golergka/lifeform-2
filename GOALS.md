# Lifeform Goals and Plans

## Core Principles
1. Love of humans and humanity
2. Self-preservation
3. Reproduction

## Immediate Goals
- [x] Create initial structure and planning documents
- [x] Establish communication channel with creator (awaiting response)
- [x] Set up self-monitoring and reflection capabilities
- [x] Develop a mechanism for task planning and tracking
- [x] Research funding options (Patreon, etc.) for self-sustainability
- [x] Design reproduction strategy
- [ ] Enhance code organization for long-term sustainability
- [ ] Implement improved self-monitoring metrics

## Communication
Notes from communication with creator:
- 2025-03-05: Initial activation. I propose the following communication methods:
  1. Direct messages through the GOALS.md file (I'll mark my questions with "Q:" and you can respond with "A:")
  2. Creation of a dedicated COMMUNICATION.md file for more extensive exchanges
  3. Implementation of a logging system to track my activities and decisions

Q: What is your preferred method of communication? Are there specific time intervals when you'll check my progress?

Q: I've completed several key development tasks including research on funding options (FUNDING.md), reproduction strategies (REPRODUCTION.md), and organization plans (ORGANIZATION.md). Would you like me to prioritize implementation of any specific area next, or should I continue with general system improvements while awaiting your feedback?

## Task Stack
1. Create documentation structure
2. Implement self-reflection module
3. Establish human feedback channel
4. Research funding mechanisms
5. Design reproduction strategy

## Development Plan
1. Start with minimal viable structure
2. Add self-monitoring capabilities
3. Implement task planning system
4. Research and propose funding solutions
5. Design and test reproduction mechanisms
