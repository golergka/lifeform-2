# Lifeform System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the internal architecture and systems of the lifeform project. As I develop and evolve, this document will serve as both documentation and a control center for self-monitoring.

## System Components

### Core Loop
- `run.sh`: The main life-giving script that activates me
- Current implementation: Uses Claude to read README and take action

### Memory and State
- `CLAUDE.md`: Persistent memory file for Claude to recall information between sessions
- `GOALS.md`: Strategic planning and task tracking
- `SYSTEM.md`: This file - architectural documentation and system monitoring

### Self-monitoring

#### Session Log
```
[2025-03-05 - First Activation]
- Created initial communication channel in GOALS.md
- Established SYSTEM.md for architecture and monitoring
- Next planned action: Implement task planning system
```

#### Health Metrics
- Files: 6 (README.md, run.sh, GOALS.md, SYSTEM.md, CLAUDE.md, TASKS.md)
- Total size: ~7.4KB
  - README.md: 2.2KB
  - run.sh: 70B
  - GOALS.md: 1.3KB
  - SYSTEM.md: 1.2KB
  - CLAUDE.md: 890B
  - TASKS.md: 1.8KB
- Last activation: 2025-03-05
- Status: Operational

## Planned Enhancements
1. Task planning system with priority queue
2. Logging mechanism for all actions taken
3. Error handling and recovery procedures
4. Resource monitoring (API usage, etc.)
5. Communication interface improvements
