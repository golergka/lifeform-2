# GitHub PR Module Test Documentation

This document outlines test scenarios for the GitHub PR and issue management implementation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Repository Status Check

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/github_pr.sh status
```

**Expected Result:**
- Repository information is displayed
- Open pull requests are listed (if any)
- Open issues are listed (if any)
- Recent repository activities are shown

**Actual Result:**
- Successfully displayed repository information
- Correctly showed there are no open pull requests
- Correctly showed there are no open issues
- Displayed 5 most recent repository activities (all PushEvents)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 2. Authentication Check

**Command:**
```bash
# Test by temporarily modifying the check_gh_cli function (don't actually modify the file)
./modules/communication/github_pr.sh status
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script verifies GitHub CLI is installed
- Script verifies GitHub CLI is authenticated

**Actual Result:**
- Script properly detected authentication status
- GitHub CLI is authenticated and working correctly

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 3. Error Handling for Invalid PR Number

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/github_pr.sh pr-view 999999
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script should handle the error gracefully when a non-existent PR is requested
- Appropriate error message should be displayed

**Actual Result:**
- Script successfully handled the invalid PR number
- Error message displayed: "GraphQL: Could not resolve to a PullRequest with the number of 999999. (NotFound)"

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 4. PR Listing Functionality

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/github_pr.sh pr-list
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script should list open pull requests or indicate there are none
- Output should be well-formatted

**Actual Result:**
- Script correctly showed there are currently no open pull requests
- Output was well-formatted and easy to read

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 5. Issue Listing Functionality

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/github_pr.sh issue-list
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script should list open issues or indicate there are none
- Output should be well-formatted

**Actual Result:**
- Script correctly showed there are currently no open issues
- Output was well-formatted and easy to read

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Test Summary

All test scenarios for the GitHub PR module have been successfully executed. The module is functioning as expected with proper error handling and authentication verification.

**Overall Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Known Limitations

1. Testing of PR reviewing functionality requires an actual open PR to test against
2. Comment functionality testing requires permissions and an actual issue/PR

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for real-world usage scenarios
2. Document any additional edge cases discovered during usage
3. Consider implementing automated test scripts for continuous validation
