# PR Review Workflow Test Documentation

This document outlines test scenarios for the automated PR review workflow implementation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Dependencies Check

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/pr_review.sh help
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script correctly shows the help message
- All required dependencies are checked and confirmed

**Test Steps:**
1. Run help command
2. Verify the help message displays correctly
3. Check if any dependency warnings are shown

**Status:** ⬜ NOT TESTED

### 2. Workflow Explanation

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/pr_review.sh workflow
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script displays a clear explanation of the PR review workflow
- All steps of the process are described in order
- Benefits of the workflow are explained

**Test Steps:**
1. Run workflow command
2. Verify the explanation is comprehensive and accurate
3. Ensure all key workflow steps are covered

**Status:** ⬜ NOT TESTED

### 3. Error Handling for Invalid PR Number

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/pr_review.sh review 999999
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script handles the error gracefully when a non-existent PR is requested
- Appropriate error message is displayed
- No changes to the local repository state occur

**Test Steps:**
1. Note current branch
2. Run command with invalid PR number
3. Verify error message is displayed
4. Confirm still on the same branch with no state changes

**Status:** ⬜ NOT TESTED

### 4. Stashing Uncommitted Changes

**Test Preparation:**
```bash
# Create a sample change
echo "# Test change" >> README.md
```

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/pr_review.sh review [valid-pr-number]
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script detects and stashes uncommitted changes
- After review process, uncommitted changes are restored
- Working directory is in the same state as before the review

**Test Steps:**
1. Make an uncommitted change to README.md
2. Run review command with a valid PR number
3. Verify stash messages in the output
4. After completion, check that README.md still has the uncommitted change

**Status:** ⬜ NOT TESTED

### 5. Complete Review Workflow

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/pr_review.sh review [valid-pr-number]
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script successfully checks out the PR branch
- Claude is launched with the review context
- Review is submitted via GitHub API
- Original branch is restored

**Test Steps:**
1. Note current branch
2. Run review command with a valid PR number
3. Monitor the process through all stages
4. Verify the review is submitted in GitHub
5. Confirm return to original branch

**Status:** ⬜ NOT TESTED

## Test Summary

The PR review workflow tests will verify:
1. Proper dependency checking
2. Clear workflow documentation
3. Error handling for invalid inputs
4. Proper state management (stashing/restoring changes)
5. End-to-end review process

**Overall Status:** ⏳ PENDING TESTS

## Known Limitations

1. Testing the full workflow requires an actual open PR to test against
2. Claude CLI must be properly configured for the review process
3. GitHub authentication must be set up via the gh CLI tool

## Next Steps

1. Complete all test scenarios with actual PRs
2. Document any edge cases discovered during testing
3. Consider enhancements based on test results
