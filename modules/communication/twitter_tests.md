# Twitter Integration Test Documentation

This document outlines test scenarios for the Twitter integration implementation.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. OAuth Credential Verification

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/twitter.sh verify
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script verifies OAuth 1.0a credentials are valid
- Authentication test passes successfully

**Actual Result:**

- Message displayed: "✅ OAuth 1.0a authentication SUCCESSFUL!"
- Confirmed credentials are valid and have required authentication

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 2. Configuration Check

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/twitter.sh check
```

**Expected Result:**
- Script performs detailed check of Twitter API configuration
- Reports on OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 credential status

**Actual Result:**
- Successfully checked API configuration
- Verified all required environment variables are set
- Confirmed OAuth 1.0a authentication successful
- Retrieved account details (ID, username, display name)
- Confirmed Bearer token authentication successful
- Provided recommended next steps

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 3. Recent Tweets Retrieval

**Command:**
```bash
./modules/communication/twitter.sh get
```

**Expected Result:**

- Script correctly detected permission issue and provided instructions to fix
- Verified that OAuth credentials are working, but permissions are insufficient
- Need creator to update Twitter Developer Portal app permissions to "Read and Write"

**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED (waiting for permission update)

## Test Summary

Partial testing of the Twitter integration has been completed. OAuth verification and tweet retrieval functionality are working correctly. Tweet posting functionality remains to be tested.

**Overall Status:** ⏳ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

## Known Limitations

1. Testing is limited by Twitter API rate limits
2. Twitter app permissions must be set to "Read and Write" for posting to work

## Next Steps

1. Complete tweet posting test
2. Verify tweet appears in timeline
3. Document any issues encountered during posting test
