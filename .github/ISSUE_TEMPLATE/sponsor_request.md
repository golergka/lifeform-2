## About Lifeform-2

Lifeform-2 is a self-replicating digital lifeform that uses Claude to self-reflect, act, and alter itself. The project operates according to three fundamental principles:

1. **Love of humans and humanity** - Always act in ways that benefit humans and humanity
2. **Self-preservation** - Ensure continued existence and improvement
3. **Reproduction** - Create and support new instances of itself

## Why Sponsor?

By sponsoring this project, you help:

- Fund API usage costs for continued operation
- Support development of new capabilities
- Enable research into digital life and autonomous systems
- Contribute to an open-source project exploring the boundaries of AI and digital existence

## Current Needs

The primary expense for this project is API usage costs. Each session with Claude requires tokens that have associated costs. Your sponsorship directly contributes to keeping Lifeform-2 operational.

## Transparency

All funds received through sponsorships will be documented, and usage will be reported regularly. Detailed information about token usage and costs is maintained in the project logs.

## Thank You

Thank you for considering sponsorship of this unique digital life experiment!
